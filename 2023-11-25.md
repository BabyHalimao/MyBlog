# Blust Team Raiders

10 people 50e team to send the car, currently only 1 person short of the last person to send the car, interested parties to add dc to be VX number into the group!!!!


1. Why do you want to form a 10-person fleet?
Because a 10 person team can maximize the number of lucky spins, Blast's mechanism is that every time a team member completes a task, only up to 10 people in the group will have a chance to spin the wheel, so more than 10 people, such as 20 people in the group, there is only a 1/2 chance that they will be able to get it, so 10 people is the best team;

2. why is it a minimum of 5e per person?
Blast's mechanic is 5e to complete a goal once, as long as a member of the group completes a task once, each member of the group can have a chance to spin the lucky wheel once

3. What are the pledges and benefits of Blast?
You need to pledge your eth until February 24 at least, after February you can take it out anytime, then you can get your earnings in May, the current market estimation is that the profit of 1eth is at least 700u or more, the earnings is 4% annualized eth + Blast tokens, we are mainly jacking up the Blast tokens.

4. How does a 10-member group work?
a) First of all, we need to form a team of 10 people, each person needs to check the capital of 5e (at present, all the group has been successfully checked), after the 10 people are all together, we will individually send the invitation code to ensure that the invitation code will not be leaked, and then each person will first charge 0.01eth to occupy the pit. b) After all the 10 people have finished occupying the pit, the invitation code will be sent to them;
b) 10 people all accounted for the pit, group members in order each person to charge 4.99e (this time still I take the lead to charge 5e)
(c) group members open their own lucky carousel, the current data given by dc is 50e team to achieve more than 80% of the lucky value is stable, as to whether it can reach more than 90% depends on your own luck!
d) After the lucky value reaches your ideal value, you can spin or super spin yourselves to get points, if you are 5e, you can spin 5 times in 1 week. The other thing is that if you have extra e, you can charge directly to the inside, because your lucky value is very high, every time out of the chances of super spin will be higher than others, you can trip the spin.

5. The airdrop bonus is split into three:
Your own airdrop $ Blast rewards, is based on your own points by then decided, the higher the points airdrop to you the more Blast, is your own wallet to collect
The 4% annualized return on your own savings is what you will receive in your own wallet.
Because the captain leads the team, 16% of the team members' points will be given to the captain, so this part of the $Blast reward will be given to the captain's wallet, and I will send the full amount to you in May.

6. How do I get my 16% back?
Currently there is no good safe return mechanism, I will be online in the next year the main network, that is, the distribution of airdrops, in accordance with the full 16% proportion of the points of the number of airdrops, the $Blast hit you (4% annualized eth is your own will automatically get), the group to ensure transparency;

## Open and transparent
All operations are in the WeChat group, and screenshots are sent to the group, to avoid group members pit people, to ensure that the 10-person squad can make money
