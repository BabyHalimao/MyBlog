USTC of terra is coming back to life, like ftt.

Terra’s USTC is a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin that is built on the Terra blockchain. It is designed to track the price of the US dollar and is scalable, yield-bearing, and value-pegged to the US dollar 12. USTC was created to deliver value to the Terra community and offer a scalable solution for DeFi amid severe scalability problems faced by other stablecoin leaders like Dai 1.

USTC provides several benefits that have made it a stand-out stablecoin competitor. Due to its minting mechanism, USTC meets the requirements of DeFi protocols that it uses without losing scalability. USTC can also be easily added to crypto wallets by simply integrating TerraUSD as a payment method. Another area where USTC has shown its power is DApps. For example, platforms that mint fungible synthetic assets and track real-life asset prices use USTC as a pricing benchmark 1.

USTC is value-pegged to the US dollar, and its supply and demand determine its value 1. The stablecoin’s cost is guaranteed as the Dropship protocol helps maintain scalability 1. USTC can be used in conjunction with LUNA, Terra’s non-stablecoin crypto, or as a standalone token 1.

TerraUSD (UST) is the first decentralized stablecoin that provides interest earnings, incredible scalability, and easier interchain movement 1. Do Kwon and Daniel Shin founded Terra (LUNA) in April 2019. In September 2020, they launched TerraUSD on Bittrex Global. Since that date, TerraUSD has outstripped many stablecoin competitors in the market, such as GUSD (Gemini) and PAX (Paxos)
